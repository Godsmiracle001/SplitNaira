## Advisory Summary

| Field                 | Detail                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Package**           | <!-- e.g. `express`, `@stellar/stellar-sdk` -->        |
| **Affected versions** | <!-- e.g. `< 4.19.2` -->                               |

## Impact Assessment

**Which workspaces are affected?**

- [ ] `backend/`
- [ ] `frontend/`
- [ ] `contracts/`
- [ ] `libs/`
- [ ] Other: <!-- specify -->

**Is the vulnerable code path reachable in production?**

<!-- Describe the attack surface. Is the affected function/module called with untrusted input? -->

**Estimated risk given our usage:**

<!-- Low / Medium / High — explain briefly -->

## Remediation Plan

- [ ] Bump package to fixed version in the affected workspace(s)
- [ ] Run `npm audit` / `cargo audit` after upgrade and confirm clean
- [ ] Run affected workspace tests locally
- [ ] Update `docs/reports/SECURITY_FIX_SUMMARY.md` if the fix is non-trivial
- [ ] Verify CI passes (dependency-audit workflow)

**Target PR merge date:** <!-- e.g. within 24 h for Critical, 72 h for High -->

## Verification

- [ ] `npm audit --audit-level=high` exits 0 after upgrade
- [ ] No regression in affected workspace unit/integration tests
- [ ] CHANGELOG entry added if the upgrade is user-visible

## Notes

<!-- Additional context, workarounds applied in the interim, or links to upstream changelog -->
